On this service portfolio I want to present the jobs that I have done along my professional life.

I am a Full stack web developer and I have just started [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/){:target="_blank"} an online school for developers that uses the pair programming methodology (Driver - Navigator) to tackle a wide curriculum that contains HTML, CSS, Ruby, SQL, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React & Redux etc.

By the time I am writing this post I have just ended the first program month and I am very satisfied, I have completely dominated HTML and CSS to develop any kind of web page, use any framework or even create my own CSS framework.
