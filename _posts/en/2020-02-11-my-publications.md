# Publications

### A solution to The Height Problem?

This is a publication that I have made for medium, and is a particularly nice example of the usage of the sticky property. besides stick the navbar on the top of the layout in the browser it is possible to use this property to arrange the content of your multiple columns webpage and make it more professional.

### Stop coding bad practices

Once you get into the journey of becoming a professional programmer the deeper you go into the material the more you know you have to learn. It is natural to focus on solving each an every problem that you tackle without thinking too much how to use many small solutions and integrate them into a piece of software that eventually will have a commercial value.

In this article is presented some of the most fundamental principals to start writing beautiful modularized and readable code.

# Intended Publications

I think I know and use a bunch of technologies that make life easier, as a builder I always focus on doing things as simple and quick as possible, for many situations I start wondering if it is possible to build a peace of software that helps to do some thing or the other, some times I have even start building solutions and I realize that what I would like to do already exists and some times don't. so, I will try to remember some of the solutions that I would like to build and the respective publications.

### An SVG tutorial

SVG is a super power tool that extends the capabilities of html, recently I have seen a video tutorial that remembered me how wonderful will be to document more of its capabilities and how easy is to use it. [Inline SVG https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af4ZQJ14yu8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af4ZQJ14yu8){:target="_blank"}

<p>&nbsp;</p>

some of the topics will include:

- Create map shapes using svg
- How to edit and create complex svg images

### All the commands to start a full-stack application

This is the kind of solutions that I really need all the time, It happens that I want to start a new project from scratch and I have to start browsing for some of the commands that I forget, how to set up a rails app with react, how to start the Rspec testing suite, how to configure all the scss system, how to set up devise and a long etc.

### Arduino sensors

I have learnt a lot of electronics just bothering around with some electronic circuits and I think is very easy to build something useful and practical. I have a bunch of Ideas using Arduino, and more than a tutorial or an article this will be more like a whole suit :D

### ArcGIS Tutorials

As my background is on Geographic information Sciences & Systems I would really like to create more content on this topic, I have already created some and it has an amazing success

I think that at this point is good for now so, if you want to hurry me up for one of this publications, then don't hesitate to contact me
