I have readed a bunch of articles in the web about the portfolio that a web developer should have, at the begining I just wanted to know some basic things like the best projects to show on a porfolio or what programming language should I show I domain the most.

Is shocking to start looking for some weird advices that start by saying the things that you should not to show, ok there are some obvious cases that worth to metion like personal cleaning and dressing but there are some silly advices and even inmoral, why should I hide my past if I have one that took me where I am?.
