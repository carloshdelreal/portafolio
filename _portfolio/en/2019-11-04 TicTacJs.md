## Generalities

An online game designed to emulate the traditional two-player Tic Tac Toe coded in JavaScript. It was created completely from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, you can check the game live version at [Tic Tac Js Live Version](https://carloshdelreal.github.io/tic-tac-js/){:target="_blank"}. If you want to checkout the code look at the repository on [Tic Tac Js Game Repository](https://github.com/carloshdelreal/tic-tac-js){:target="_blank"}

## Game Flow

The game begins when you click “Start Game.” Intuitive, right?

A series of prompts will then appear on the screen asking you for data. The first prompt will confirm that you want to start the game

In the second prompt, you will type your name.

A third prompt will allow you to type Player 2’s name.

You can then select which player stars first, and which symbol you want to use 
(X or O).

Then you start playing! :D
As you click the desired square, the screen will prompt the next player until one player wins or both players tie. If a player wins, the screen will show the winner and highlight the winning row, column, or diagonal.
