## Generalities

The Fakebook Web Application is a Ruby on Rails Project that implements many of the Facebook Social Network, we have a list of users to which we can send friend requests, we as registered users receive friend requests, we are able to login with user name and password, update the profile, with a profile photo, create posts with images, create comments on friends posts and like them.

Check out the [Fakebook Web App](https://frozen-everglades-48914.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"} and register. The site [uses SSFL and thus is very secure](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security){:target="_blank"}. 

If you want to check out the code, take a look at the project’s repository on GitHub [Fakebook Project's Repository](https://github.com/trox115/Fakebook){:target="_blank"}
