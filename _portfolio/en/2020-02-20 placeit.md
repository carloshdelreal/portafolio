## Generalities

A full-stack web application that allows anybody to create movies with title, synopsis, URL and pick the dates that the movie will appear on the mainboard. You can filter the movies by date so you can reserve with your name, e-mail, cedula or id the movie that you want to watch and of course the date.

This application is implemented with a backend that works as an API from which you can get the desired data, query information as well as submit more information.

The Placeit Application was created as a test for the Magneto Company [Magneto 365](https://www.magneto.com){:target="_blank"}
