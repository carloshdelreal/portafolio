## Generalities

A full-stack web application that allows anybody to create movies with title, synopsis, and URL, and then pick the dates that the movie will appear on the dashboard. You can filter the movies by date so you can reserve seats for the movie/date you want to select by using your name, e-mail, cedula, or ID. This application is implemented with a backend that works as an API from which you can pull the desired data, query information, and submit more information.
