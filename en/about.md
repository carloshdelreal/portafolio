I am a curious person, I really like to create things and **solving** real and challenging problems. I am a former Geologist with Specialization in Geotechnical Engineering, I Studied Disaster Risk Reduction in Japan thanks to [JICA Japan International Cooperation Agency](https://www.jica.go.jp/english/index.html) and Geophysics, Seismology and Earthquake Engineering thanks to the sponsor of [GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/about-us/organisation/gfz-profile/), Currently I am on a Master's degree on Geographic Information Science & Systems at the University of Salzburg Austria. I was a Cadet at the Colombian Air Force and at that time I was a high level basketball player.


### Why a web developer?

My home country of Colombia is, as you might know, a developing country, and there are many fundamental societal problems that are waiting for solutions. I am committed to trying to solve some of those problems, and that commitment led me to development. I have enjoyed many experiences over the past several years, and the long history of my life has made me interested in learning about many topics. I am always learning, from new web technologies to Geophysics to electronics.

Web development has the potential to tackle huge fundamental and complex societal problems-- and actually solve them! It is very easy to feel frustrated in other engineering fields, such as Geotechnical Engineering or Geology, where you can propose theoretical solutions to terrible problems but canâ€™t always implement those solutions due to cost (believe me, there is nothing more frustrating than that). But web development allows people to implement solutions quickly and at scale, and therefore has the potential to help change the world for the better.
